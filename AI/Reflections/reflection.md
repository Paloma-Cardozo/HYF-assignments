Reflection!

_1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task._

I learned:

- How small CSS spacing changes can affect the whole visual balance,
- How to organize CSS more effectively,
- How JavaScript event listeners can change styles dynamically.

GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT explained the logic, which made the corrections easier to understand.

_2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?_

I had to adjust the button’s margin and the body padding because the AI’s initial suggestion made the button stick to the bottom. I also tweaked some color choices to make them softer and more readable. The code worked technically, but didn’t look or feel right until I adjusted it manually.

_3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?_

Using Copilot to generate code can be faster but often superficial. Copilot and ChatGPT can write code for you, but that doesn’t mean you learn.
As a learning partner, AI helps you reason through problems and understand the “why” behind the code. It can guide you step by step, so you grow as a developer.
The key difference is that using Copilot and/or ChatGPT to generate code gives results, while using it as a learning partner builds understanding.

_4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture._

- AI can reduce your problem-solving skills,
- AI can make you dependent on suggestions instead of exploration,
- AI can limit your creativity when designing solutions.

When you code with AI all the time, you might get lazy about understanding the code, specially if you trust every suggestion blindly, and fail to build your own debugging skills.
